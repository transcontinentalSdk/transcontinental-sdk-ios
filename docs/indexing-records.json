Although the example below demonstrates a logger using simple print statements, it’s expected that this logger will utilize the same console, file, or cloud logging system as the host application. The logger is a static object within the TCDigitalFlyer module. It’s advisable to assign it before initializing the SDK, though you can do so at any time or leave it nil. For production, the host application should refrain from logging debug and verbose volumes as they may contain sensitive URLs or tokens.  Initializing the SDK To retrieve your flyers, you will need the Transcontinental subscription key for your account. This key will be provided when registering your application with Transcontinental. The SDK uses this key internally to communicate with the Web API. Before using any APIs, initialize the SDK with your subscription key and client name:  subscriptionKey - You receive this key when you register your application with Transcontinental client - The client’s name, as provided by Transcontinental banner - An optional banner, as provided by Transcontinental (defaults to the value provided to client) environment - The API Environment (defaults to live) While it’s technically possible to instantiate multiple DigitalFlyer objects with the same inputs on-demand, it’s recommended to use a single instance throughout your application (e.g. a reference in your AppDelegate or environmentObject). Instantiating multiple DigitalFlyer objects with different inputs is not currently supported. It will result in undefined behavior. Listing Available Publications The DigitalFlyer SDK provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve digital flyers using the listPublications(storeId:completion:) method. Upon successful retrieval, a list of Publication.Attribute objects will be returned.  storeId - The store’s identifier language - The Publication’s display Language (an enum defaulting to .english) date - The date to search for available Publications (defaults to today) completion - A closure that returns Publication.Attributes for the available Publications on the main DispatchQueue. Retrieving a Publication Once you have a list of Publication.Attribute objects, you can retrieve a Publication object using the getPublication(attribute:completion:) method.  attribute - The Publication.Attribute object returned from listPublications(storeId:language:date:completion:) completion - A closure that returns a Publication object on the main DispatchQueue. Rendering a Publication The FlyerView is a custom view that serves as the entry point for displaying the digital flyer. It accepts the publication to display, along with a configuration object that governs its visual and functional behavior.  frame - The frame of the host UIView publication - The Publication object returned from getPublication(attribute:completion:) configuration - A FlyerView.Configuration object that governs the visual and functional behavior of the FlyerView event - A FlyerView.Event object that represents an event emitted by the FlyerView As of version 2.0.0, the FlyerView supports the following configuration options: showHeader - A boolean that determines whether the header should be displayed (defaults to true) headerHeight - The height of the header (defaults to 50px when shown) The following events are emitted by the FlyerView: sku - The SKU of the product whose click region was tapped Error Handling Error handling in the DigitalFlyer SDK is represented through the DFError enum, which covers various cases including unauthorized access, missing subscription key, or missing resources. Here are the possible error scenarios: unauthorized: Represents an unauthorized request, usually due to an invalid subscription key. notFound: The requested resource was not found on the server. This could happen if the resource was deleted, or if the resource was not correctly specified. publicationNotFound: Indicates a failed request due to an unavailable publication. missingSubscriptionKey: This error occurs when the subscriptionKey is not provided during DigitalFlyer initialization. missingClient: Occurs when the client parameter is missing during DigitalFlyer initialization. missingBanner: This error indicates that the banner parameter is missing during DigitalFlyer initialization. invalid: A generic error case for any other unidentified issue.","kind":"article","title":"Using the SDK","headings":["Logging API","Initializing the SDK","Listing Available Publications","Retrieving a Publication","Rendering a Publication","Error Handling"],"location":{"type":"topLevelPage","reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/TCDigitalFlyer\/documentation\/TCDigitalFlyer\/using-the-sdk","interfaceLanguage":"swift"}},"summary":""},{"rawIndexableTextContent":"The API environments supported by the SDK ","kind":"symbol","title":"Environment","headings":[],"location":{"type":"topLevelPage","reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/TCDigitalFlyer\/documentation\/TCDigitalFlyer\/Environment","interfaceLanguage":"swift"}},"summary":"The API environments supported by the SDK"},{"rawIndexableTextContent":" ","kind":"symbol","title":"warning(_:)","headings":[],"location":{"type":"topLevelPage","reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/TCDigitalFlyer\/documentation\/TCDigitalFlyer\/Logger-swift.protocol\/warning(_:)","interfaceLanguage":"swift"}},"summary":""},{"rawIndexableTextContent":"Inherited from UIScrollViewDelegate.scrollViewDidEndZooming(_:with:atScale:).

This results in less “janky” scrolling when viewing very large flyers Reduced bandwidth requirements by enabling HTTP Range Requests to allow partial downloads, instead of re-downloads Reduced likelihood of temporarily blank screens by dynamically changing download\/rendering priorities to prefer what should be currently on-screen, and deferring all off-screen images These updates will facilitate some upcoming performance enhancements, namely pre-fetching. Pre-fetching will allow the SDK to optionally download and cache images before they are needed, resulting in a much smoother user experience and an even lower time to first image. These improvements are the result of a significant re-write of the SDK’s rendering engine, and as such, we are releasing this as a breaking version change. Initializing the SDK In v1.x, the SDK was initialized via a singleton and using two methods. In v2.x, interaction with the SDK occurs through an instance of DigitalFlyer, and it’s up to the consumer to manage the lifecycle of this object however fits their workflow. Refer to init(subscriptionKey:client:banner:environment:) and Using the SDK for more information.  Listing Available Publications In v1.x, available Publications were retrieved via the onLandingResponse using static SDK parameters and helper methods. In lieu of this, v2.x provides a listPublications(storeId:language:date:completion:) method on the DigitalFlyer object, which returns a list of Publication.Attributes objects. Refer to Using the SDK for details.  Retrieving and Rendering a Publication The v1.x SDK did not have an explicit method for retrieving a Publication. Instead, the onLandingResponse callback provided an object that was used to populate the parameters of a VerticalView or horizontalController. The publication would be downloaded and rendered in one step (with a lot of boilerplate). In lieu of this, v2.x provides an explicit getPublication(from:completion:) method on the DigitalFlyer object, which returns a Publication object. This object is passed downstream to the FlyerView renderer, along with an optional FlyerView.Configuration object. Refer to Using the SDK for more details.
