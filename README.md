# Transcontinental iOS SDK

The `Transcontinental iOS SDK` is an easy way to interact with the Transcontinental Web API in order to access digital flyers. The SDK also provides pre-built UI components to allow users to browse through live flyers and retrieve detailed product information.

The `TCDigitalFlyerUI` contains extensions and components to integrate the Transcontinental iOS SDK into a SwiftUI application, while also providing an easily themeable search and filter UI.
